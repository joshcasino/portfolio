    <h2>About:</h2>
    <p>
      I have spent the last 6 years working as a shipping / receiving manager of an independant bookstore, Bank Street Childrens Bookstore, in Manhattan, and freelance photographer. Somewhat of an institution for the childrens book industry, I realized that due to a physical ailment and the ever rising costs of living in NYC, it was time for a change. It was simply not paying the bills, neither financial or health wise. Photography is a grind itself, that while passionate about, must be a secondary career at almost 40 years old. I may still make it there, but believe in preparing for all situations.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is what brings me to Epicodus. Coding is a world I struggle with, but love seeing how it works. The victory in finding success is so rewarding. The chance to change my life was too great to pass up.
